This is my first project using HTML and CSS. It is a visual clone of Google's homepage. The only real "functionality" it has is a link to my GitHub profile when the user icon in the top right corner is clicked. In making this, my main takeaway is that I became more comfortable with CSS flexboxes. I also learned a lot about how CSS styles are inherited and overwritten. The page is slightly responsive, though there might be some shortcomings. This is the first step for me, so the code may not be the best. I still have a ways to go. For now, I am enjoying the learning process.
